# passbook

Graphical interface for the unix password manager.

## todo:

- Define directory
- inventory all files
- inventory file paths
- search for a file, display the file path just to make sure it's working
- hook into gpg and use it to decrypt the file, show password
- put password in clipboard
- clear clipboard after interval
- UI time!
